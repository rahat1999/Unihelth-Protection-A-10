## Discription
* A hospital is a health-care facility that provides specialised medical and nursing care as well as medical supplies to patients. The most well-known form of the hospital is the general hospital, which usually carries an emergency department to handle urgent health issues such as fire and accident victims, as well as medical emergencies.
* According to the hospital definition, a district hospital is usually the region's primary health-care facility, with a large number of intensive-care beds and extra beds for patients who need long-term care. Trauma centres, children's hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, hospitals and seniors' (geriatric) hospitals for coping with particular medical conditions such as psychiatric care are also examples of specialised hospitals and several other disease categories. When opposed to general hospitals, specialised hospitals can help save money on health care. Based on the source of revenue, hospitals are categorised as general, specialised, or government.
